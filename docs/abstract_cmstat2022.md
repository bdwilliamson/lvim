Title: Inference for model-agnostic longitudinal variable importance

In many applications, it is of interest to assess the relative contribution of features (or subsets of features) toward the goal of predicting a response; in other words, to gauge the variable importance of features. I will discuss a general framework for nonparametric inference on interpretable algorithm-agnostic variable importance, where variable importance is defined as a population-level contrast in oracle prediction potential between two nested groups of features. In this framework, valid confidence intervals and tests may be constructed, even when machine learning techniques are used. I will further discuss several approaches to summarizing the longitudinal importance of variables and to making inference on these summaries.
